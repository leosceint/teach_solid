# Principles

- SRP - Single Responsibility Principle. **I do what I am responsible for.**
- OCP - Open-Closed Principle. **Opened for extension. Closed for modification**
- LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle. **Sub-class worked similar as super-class in code that call them. Therefore the program continues to work correctly.**
- ISP - Interface Segregation Principle. **It's better have several small interfaces than big one.**
- DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle.  **It's better sub-module and super-module depend on interfaces, but not between themselfes.**
